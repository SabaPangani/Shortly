## About The Project
Your challenge is to integrate with the shrtcode API to create shortened URLs and display them like in the designs.

You can use any JavaScript framework/library on the front-end such as React or Vue. You also have complete control over which packages you use to do things like make HTTP requests or style your project.

<br><br>Users should be able to:
- view the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- shorten any valid URL
- see a list of their shortened links, even after refreshing the browser
- Copy the shortened link to their clipboard in a single click
- Receive an error message when the form is submitted if: The input field is empty
- 
<br> <p>I do not have access to the Figma sketch so the design is not pixel perfect.</p>




## Built with 

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flex
- JavaScript
